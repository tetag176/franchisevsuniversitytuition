          <h1>CAFÉ CARTOGRAPHY: WHAT CAMPUS COFFEE SAYS ABOUT NYC UNIVERSITIES</h1>
          <p class="hero-text">
            I walked the digital streets of New York — through Google Maps, tuition pages, and café counts —
            to see how <strong>Starbucks vs independent coffee shops</strong> cluster around ten NYC universities.
          </p>
          <p class="hero-text">
            As you scroll, the visuals zoom in and out of the city, highlighting different campuses and showing
            what their coffee ecosystems say about money, neighborhood, and student life.

        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
        <p class="hypo-text">
          <strong>I started with a simple guess:</strong><br>
          <em>“Universities with higher tuition have more Starbucks and fewer independent cafés within a 10-minute walk of campus.”</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          In my head, expensive schools felt like they would attract more corporate brands, while cheaper or
          more community-focused campuses would be surrounded by smaller, local cafés.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I picked <strong>10 NYC universities</strong>, pulled tuition from official websites, then used
          Google Maps to count every <strong>Starbucks vs independent café</strong> within walking distance.

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <section id="wrapup" class="section conclusion">
      <div class="content-narrow">
        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <p>
          My hypothesis was wrong in a useful way. Higher tuition did not automatically mean more Starbucks.
          Instead, the café landscape around each campus is shaped more by <strong>neighborhood identity</strong>
          than tuition alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lower-tuition schools in dense business districts (like FIT and Baruch) ended up with the most Starbucks,
          while higher-tuition, arts-oriented or residential campuses (like The New School, Pratt, and Fordham)
          were surrounded by independent cafés. Coffee isn’t just about caffeine here—it’s a map of how corporate
          convenience and local culture balance in different slices of New York City.
        </p>
        <p class="final-line">
          In other words: show me your campus coffee, and I can guess the neighborhood you live in.
